        powerful talks (18 minutes or less). TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, 
        Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business 
        to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independently run 
        TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.`,

            subject areas that are collectively shaping our world. But a TED conference 
            is broader still, showcasing important ideas from any discipline, 
            and exploring how they all connect. The format is fast-paced: 50+ talks over 
            the course of a week, as well as morning and evening get-togethers. As they take 
            in the program, attendees and speakers from vastly different fields can 
            cross-fertilize and draw inspiration from unlikely places. This is the magic of TED.`,
